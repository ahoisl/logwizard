This fork of the tool [LogWizard](https://github.com/jtorjo/logwizard) was created as part of a summer internship at Ranorex. It improves on the tool in various ways, also fixing and implementing some of the original repository's issues.

Originally, **LogWizard** was created by [John Torjo](https://github.com/jtorjo):
> I created **LogWizard** to help anyone that really needs to deal with logs, in order to _hunt down bugs and/or issues that happen somewhere else_ (read = at customer site). My focus has been on ease of use from the get go. When using LogWizard, most things should be easy.
